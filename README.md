# Mini-Project 1 - EPFL BA1 2020 - Cryptography

## Description

 This project is an introduction to encryption and decryption methods in general, as applied to computer science.

## What's in it ?

  ### Encryption
    
  There are 5 encryption methods:\
    - Caesar\
    - Vigenere\
    - XOR\
    - OTP\
    - CBC\
    and a generator of random pad
    
  ### Decryption
  There are 5 decryption methods:\
    - Caesar with Brute Force\
    - Caesar with frequencies\
    - Vigenere with frequencies\
    - XOR with Brute Force\
    - CBC knowing the initialisation vector
    
  ### Bonus
  
   1. Shell\
   Programm in the terminal that create an interaction with the user. 
   Follow the instructions of the programm and it will encrypt or decrypt a text that you will enter as input.
    
   2. More CBC\
   There are 2 additional methods to encrypt and decrypt using the CBC encryption as basis:
      - CBC applied to a text then Caesar applied too
      - Propagating CBC method (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC )
