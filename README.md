# Mini-Project 1 - EPFL BA1 2020 - Cryptography

## Description

 This project is an introduction to encryption and decryption methods in general, as applied to computer science.

## What's in it ?

  ### Encryption
    
  There are 5 encryption methods
    - Caesar
    - Vigenere
    - XOR
    - OTP
    - CBC + a random generate pad
    
  ### Decryption
  
  There are   decryption methods
    - Caesar with Brute Force
    - Caesar with Frequencies
    - Vigenere with Frequencies
    - XOR with Brute Force
    - CBC with the Initial Pad
    
  ### Bonus
  
    1. Shell
    
    Programm in the terminal that create an iteraction with the user. Follow the instructions of the programm and it will encrypt or decrypt a text that you will enter as input.
    
    2. More CBC
    
    There are 1 additional method to encrypt and decrypt the CBC with caesar too.
